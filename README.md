A Python implementation of the SPA model for classification.

This Python code implements the model described in: Liu, Q.; Ruan, H.; Xing, D.; Tang, H.; Pan, G.; and Benosman, R., "Effective AER Object Classification Using Segmented Probability-Maximization Learning in Spiking Neural Networks," AAAI2020.

The code shows how to apply the model to the recordings with the first 200ms of MNIST-DVS dataset described in: Lichtsteiner, P.; Posch, C.; and Delbruck, T. 2008. A 128×128 120 db 15μs latency asynchronous temporal contrast vision sensor. IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits 43(2):566–576.

This implementation on the recordings with the first 200ms of MNIST-DVS dataset achieves the classification accuracy of 92.7% on average, with a standard deviation of 0.8%.
